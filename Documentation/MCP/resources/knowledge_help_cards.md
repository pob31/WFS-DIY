*System Overview*
This WFS spatial sound processor aims to be a tool for natural sound reinforcement and also a creative tool opening new avenues for writing sound in space.
Some parameters are straightforward: place sound (Tracking, Speed Limiting, Gradient Maps...), work its shape (Attenuation Profile) and its acoustic presence (Directivity, Floor Reflections), give it a one-off motion (AutomOtion) or a repetitive movement (L.F.O). In some cases amplification should be limited around loud sources on stage (Live Source Tamer). All of these functionalities can be stored and recalled internally or with the help of QLab. On the other side the system allows real-time interaction to trigger and move samples, move large clusters of inputs manually or thanks to easily recallable LFO presets.

*Session Data*
When starting a session select the working folder when the system will place the files and eventual audio files. For new projects create a new folder. When reloading a previous session navigate to the corresponding folder.
Each section has a separate xml file (System configuration, Network, Outputs, Reverbs, Inputs) and backups. Additionally convolution reverb impulse responses and audio samples will be stored in sub-directories.
Each section can be stored and recalled individually or as a whole.
Each section can also export and import files from other projects.

*Network*
The system can communicate through several network protocols, (UDP or TCP) using OSC. OSC query can be enabled to allow the clients to discover the possible OSC paths and subscribe to some parameter updates.
The IP of the local machine corresponding to the selected network interface is shown. The incoming TCP and UDP ports as well as the OSC Query port.
There are a few specialised OSC clients such as:
- Remote for the Android application for multitouch operation and for remote control.
- QLab that can send data and that can also be programmed directly from the application.
- ADM-OSC for control from consoles and DAW (see specific help).
The data can be filtered to only allow only the data from the recorded IP addresses or to allow any client sending on the correct ports.
There is a Log window to see what data comes in or out, filter by the type of protocol, client and so on.
There is also a locator function to find a lot remote Android tablet. It will flash and sound the alarm on the missing device.

*Tracking*
Tracking allows to follow the position in 2D or 3D of actors and musicians. There are several tracking solutions based on UWB (UltraWide Band) tags, 3D camera, computer vision systems and Infra-Red LED's followed by IR sensitive camera's.
This application allows you to receive tracking data from several protocols: OSC, MQTT, PosiStageNet/PSN, RTTrP.
You can select which protocol you're using and enter its settings. You may also adjust the mapping (offset, scaling and orientation).
Each input has a toggle to enable tracking, a ID to select which tracking marker it should follow and a smoothing algorithm to reduce jittery movements.

*ADM-OSC*
ADM-OSC is a protocol aiming to improve interoperability for spatial sound. It sends Cartesian positions (X, Y, Z) or polar values (AED for Azimuth, Elevation, Distance) from the console or from a DAW's automation curves.
Data is sent normalised:
- between -1.0 and 1.0 for X, Y and Z;
- between 0.0 to 1.0 for distance,
- between -180° to 180° for Azimuth
- between -90° to 90° for elevation.
The origin point can be moved and the mapping can also be adjusted in different segments for the inner and outer parts of the stage.
When dragging the handles on the graphs, holding the shift key will apply symmetrical adjustments on the opposite side.

*WFS Array Design*
The design of the WFS system has to do with the right choice of equipment and their position. Here is a guide to help you with the design and the tuning of your arrays.
An array is a line (straight or curved) of speakers. This is one of the most important concepts in WFS adapted to sound reinforcement and for creative sound design.
A rule of thumb would be that each listener should hear three speakers of an array to have enough psycho-acoustic cues to feel the direction each sound is coming from. There will be a sweet spot to find between the distance between the speakers and the listeners, their spacing and coverage angle. This is especially true for short range arrays, a.k.a front fills. Speakers with a 120° coverage angle can be spaced by the same distance between the array and the first row of listeners. The number of speakers also depends on the sound pressure level. When placed as a flown array, trapezoidal/asymmetric horns with wide coverage angle (120°) below axis and narrow coverage (60°) on axis will give good coverage for seat rows a bit too far from the ground array and will have enough throw to reach 20m or 30m away while avoiding the walls of the venue where they would create reflections that give away the position of the speakers to the ears of the listeners. Most of the time for larger venues coaxial (elliptical or conical horns) have not enough reach and require one or more delay lines. They are more suited for smaller venues with few rows of seats.
The positioning of the speakers in the system can be done through the 'Wizard of OutZ' and the editable presets it has.

*Parallax Correction*
Each speaker points more or less clearly at a listener. To calculate the delay for an input for each speaker, let's consider the distance from the input to this listener, we can also calculate the distance the sound from the speaker to this listener. To match the time of arrival of both we need to apply the difference in the aforementioned distances as a delay for this input and this speaker. This gives greater stability when inputs are moved on stage and especially when they move upstage, away from the edge of the stage. This also can enable the synthesis of floor reflections. This setting can be tuned for finer adjustments, rather than simply measured. Use your ears!

*System Tuning*
System tuning for WFS is different from standard PA tuning. It can proceed as follows:
- Start with the flown array muted. Set the desired levels for the near-field speakers when listening to them in the first row. Adjust the high frequency shelf attenuation so the near-field speakers are not too bright and draw too much attention.
- Mute the near-field array and unmute the flown array, find a suitable level towards the back of the house.
- Unmute both array, adjust the delay of the flown array to bring the sound down to the correct height in the lower rows. Adjust the levels, HF shelf/distance ratio and vertical and horizontal parallax for each array to have consistent level wherever your inputs are on stage. This is especially important if your inputs are actors, singers or acoustic music instruments on stage. You may also test adding some Haas effect to delay the whole system if you feel the WFS is too early or adding comb filtering with the acoustic sound.
You may follow a different workflow for tuning or go for different cues.

*Advanced Parameters*
There are a few parameters to help you adjust to the acoustic sound.
Most of these parameters are set for whole arrays unless the propagation mode is switched to off for this output in the array. Relative change can also be selected after a specific setting.
- Orientation and On/Off Angles define what inputs each speaker will amplify. By default the speakers are pointing to the audience, away from the stage. Inputs in the green sector will be amplified, but not the ones in front of the speaker, in the red sector. There is a fade between both sectors. For sub-bass speakers which usually come in limited numbers and locations, opening all the way to the maximum will allow you to have all inputs possibly picked up by the subwoofers.
- HF Damping simulates the loss of high frequency with distance. Speakers close to the listeners can have more than speakers away from the stage and the listeners.
- Distance Attenuation percentage allows you to define if more or less of the attenuation calculated from the distance and parameters of the input is applied. Again for Sub-bass in case you only have two and don't want to lose too much level or have hot-spots it may be wise to lower this setting to 50%.
- Minimal Latency toggles whether the output is scanned for the smallest calculated delay and also if the setting once engaged on an input will reduce the delay for that input through this speaker.
- Live Source Attenuation toggles the reduction of level of nearby input if they have this setting enabled. This may not be necessary for speakers away from the audience or for sub-bass.
- Floor Reflections toggles if the reflections are applied to the signal for this output such as sub-bass and flown arrays...

*Reverb*
Reverb helps blur the actual reflections of the speakers in the acoustic space. Without some reverb the listener might perceive the sound missing some depth because the reflections of the speakers in the acoustic of the room gives away their positions and all sounds might feel as coming from the plane of the speakers.
Place the reverb node according to the number of channels and the geometry of the stage and listening area, and the positions of speakers. If necessary the return position can be offset from the feed position.
Other parameters are very similar to Outputs' and Inputs'.

*Reverb Feed*
Pre-processing sending of the input channels to the reverb nodes.
- Orientation and On/Off Angles define what inputs each reverb node will receive. Inputs in the green sector will be picked-up, but not the ones in front in the red sector. There is a fade between both sectors.
- HF Damping simulates the loss of high frequency with distance.
- Distance Attenuation percentage allows you to define if more or less of the attenuation calculated from the distance and parameters of the input is applied.
- Minimal Latency toggles whether the output is scanned for the smallest calculated delay and also if the setting once engaged on an input will reduce the delay for that input through this reverb node.
- Live Source Attenuation toggles the reduction of level of nearby input if they have this setting enabled.

*Reverb Return*
Post-processing sending to the speakers.
- Distance Attenuation defines the level drop per meter to the speakers.
- Common Attenuation will look for the lowest attenuation and keep only a percentage of this level drop and apply this across all other outputs.
- Mutes and Mute Macros allow to prevent a reverb channel from feeding an output. For instance it may not be necessary to send reverb to sub-bass speakers.

*Reverb Pre-Processing*
Includes a 4-band EQ and a Compressor to remove transients which might excite the reverb processor a bit too much.

*Reverb Algorithms*
There are three built-in reverb types inside this spatial sound processor:
- SDN (Scattered Delay Network): The sound bounces between every reverb node which act as reflecting surfaces. This reverb algorithm favours an odd number of nodes that should not have too much symmetry. This helps reduce the artifacts of the reverb or any metallic sounding resonance.
- FDN (Feedback Delay Network): Each reverb node functions as a separate reverb processor with a classical reverb algorithm. Place nodes around the stage and eventually around the audience. Inputs are sent to each node in a similar fashion as with outputs. The return signal from the reverb is then distributed like other inputs to all outputs.
- IR (Impulse Response): This is a classical convolution reverb. You can load audio samples as impulse responses. Each reverb node can share the same IR or they can have different ones. Place nodes around the stage and eventually around the audience.
The node positions can be adjusted directly on the map. The Ctrl/Cmd key will move a reverb node pair in symmetry.

*Reverb Post-Processing*
Includes a 4-band EQ and an Expander that looks at the signal entering the reverb processor to reduce long reverb tails when the inputs are quiet.

*Inputs Basic Parameters*
Inputs have a wide variety of settings to account for different situations necessitating realistic sound reinforcement or creative tools for sound design.
- Input level can be adjusted.
- Inputs can be delayed or they can try to take into account specific latency (digital processing of wireless transmission or digital effects) and compensate for it to better align the amplification and the acoustic sound.
- Minimal Latency can be toggled instead of Acoustic Precedence. On the other hand this tries to let the sound out through the system as soon as possible. The system scans this input's feeds to the outputs for lowest delay and substracts it from all delays and bypasses additional Haas effect. Here the idea would be to beat the acoustic sound on stage to try and place a sound in a slightly different position by altering the location first perceived.
- The location (position and offset) for any input can be given in Cartesian, Cylindrical or Spherical coordinates independently from the stage shape or other channels.
- The position can be constrained to the dimensions of the stage in Cartesian coordinates or to a specific distance range in polar coordinates.
- Flip will take symmetrical position for the given coordinate around the origin point.
- The joystick and vertical slider allow relative control of the position.
- Inputs can be assigned to a cluster to group them for coordinated movements.

*Advanced controls*
- Sidelines and Fringe enable muting when an input comes close to the limits of a rectangular stage (except downstage).
- Tracking can be enabled and the ID of the tracker can be selected. The amount of smoothing on the position can also be adjusted.
- Maximum Speed can be engaged and the speed limit adjusted. The system will apply a gradual acceleration and deceleration when the movement starts and finishes. When Path is enabled, the system will track the path followed by the input and will not go in a straight line to the final position. This is especially handy if movements have to be operated manually.
- Height Factor lets you work in 2D, when set to 0%, or full 3D, when set at 100%, and anything in between. It's the ratio of the height in the level and delay calculations. If you wish to use floor reflections, set it to 100% and use the parallax correction of the output parameters.

*Level Adjustments*
There are two level attenuation models. One where the level decreases with the distance by a given ratio in dB/m. Otherwise the level is halved each time the distance doubles. This might be more realistic, but it may be too loud close to the source or not give enough focus. The former may be less physically accurate, it offers usually better control to have a more even and stable mix.

*High Frequency Directivity*
When talking away, the timbre of a voice will sound less bright. Reproducing this was the initial goal here even though we usually want to have support for voices when not addressing the audience or in bi-frontal configurations. This can be put to good use for creative effects such as having a brighter reverb on a dampened direct sound.
The orientation of the input in azimuth and in pitch can be set as well as the angle where the high frequencies will not be filtered.
The HF Shelf will set the maximum attenuation in the back of the input. There is a smooth fade (like a cosine curve) from full brightness in front to damped at the rear.

*Array Attenuation and Output Mutes*
You can set for each output array a specific attenuation for the selected input.
You can mute each send to any output individually. There are macros to speed up the process.

*Input Snapshots and Scope*
Snapshots store input parameters, but can have a scope to be recalled during a performance. They can have between all parameters for all inputs and only one parameter for a single channel. They can be updated and renamed for convenience.
The Scope tells the system what data to store or recall. It's the opposite of 'safe' parameters.
There are several ways to do this in this application:
- record only the needed data in local files. The scope filter is applied when storing the data. A recall cue can be created in QLab to trigger the reading of the local file.
- record all data and a filter in local files. The scope filter is applied when recalling the data. This allows to eventually recall all data not taking into account the scope filter. This may come in handy when a complete configuration should be recalled during rehearsal for example. A recall cue can be created in QLab to trigger the reading of the local file.
- record all data in scope in QLab cues. This should not be used to recall all parameters for large configurations since QLab may stall when recalling so much data.
The scope can show and automatically pre-select the parameters that have been manually changed (local UI, hardware controllers, remote Android application). Changed parameters are marked with a yellow mark.

*Live Source Tamer*
A loud source on stage may not need to have much reinforcement through the nearby speakers. Imagine an opera singer near the edge of the stage. Normally the level distribution would make the level louder near to the input position. But if it is already loud enough we should be able to not over-amplify it. This function is there to manage this.
The radius and shape will describe how to attenuation the level for a specific source for speakers within the radius of influence of this input. There are various shapes for a V shaped linear effect; a U shape for fast decrease within the radius; a tight V effect or a mix of the previous (sine).
The attenuation can be constant or can be level dependent like a local compression reacting to transients and to average RMS level.

*Floor Reflections*
Simulating the floor reflections improves the naturalness of the sound. We don't expect sounds to play in an soundproof anechoic chamber. This setting helps recreate the expected floor reflections.
The level of the floor reflections can be adjusted as well as low cut and the high frequency shelf filters. Diffusion adds a bit of chaos to simulate the unevenness of the floor.

*Input LFO*
Input position can be automated. The LFO can control X, Y and Z position coordinates individually as well as the rotation of HF directivity (gyrophone).
Adjust the global period and phase for the LFO.
For X, Y and Z coordinates select a shape, amplitude, rate and phase as desired. A circle in the XY plane would have sine for shape for X and for Y and an offset of ±90° between the two. A square would be the same but with keystone shapes.
Input position can be moved while the LFO is running.

*AutomOtion*
One time movement can also be programmed and triggered manually or triggered by sound level.
The coordinates are either relative from the start position or absolute relative to the origin point.
The input can either stay at the end position or revert to the starting position.
Input position cannot be changed while the input is moving this way, but interacting with the input will change the position offset of the input instead.
For audio level triggering select the sound level above which the movement will start. When the sound drops below the reset level the movement will be rearmed, ready to be triggered again. New movement automation will no be possible while the input is moving.

*Gradient maps*
Gradient maps allow to control attenuation, height and high frequency filtering (shelf with a smooth slope centered at 1kHz) depending on the X, Y position. For example, you can fade out a sound when entering a certain zone, you can have high frequency roll-off when moving away from the front of the stage, you can automatically adjust the height of an actor even when they are standing on elevated platforms without having to control height manually.
There are three layers for attenuation, height and HF shelf. They can be toggled on and off and they also can be hidden. The focused layer will look dimmed if disabled. Unfocused layers will look dimmed if active and only the shape outlines will be visible if they are deactivated.
Each layer has a mapping control for while and black to adjust the range on the effect. The curve setting adjusts the transition.
Each layer can have editable shapes (rectangle, ellipse or polygon) with either a single shade of grey, a linear gradient or a radial gradient. End points of the gradients can be adjusted.
When creating a polygon click for each corner. Double-clicking will create a last corner and close the shape.
Double-clicking an existing point on a rectangle or a polygon will remove this corner. Double-clicking on a side will add a new point.
The scale and rotation of each shape can be edited for its center or from the origin point.
When enabled the corner points of the rectangles and polygons can also be edited individually.
Shapes and layer can be copied to another layer on the same input or any other input.
Gradient map settings are stored in the input files.

*Sampler*
The sampler allows to trigger samples and interact with them in real time.
The sampler when enabled on a track will replace the live input at all times.
Several samplers can be assigned to different inputs and triggered individually.
To use the sampler:
- Select a Roli Lightpad or a pad on the connected Android Remote app.
- Add samples to the different tile in the grid to the left. Adjust their relative starting position and their level and eventually their in and out points.
Several samples can be selected using the shift key while clicking.
- Create sets of samples:
Selected samples will be added to new sets. Sample can be added or removed after the creation of a set by holding Ctrl/Cmd while clicking on the tiles.
Each set can be renamed.
Each set can either have a fixed sequence or a random (round robin, each sample is played once before a new random order is drawn).
Each set has a attenuation setting.
Each set has a base position applied to the input when selecting the set. It can be moved on the map or using external control. The sample position offset is added to the set position each time a sample is triggered.
- Press a Roli Lightpad or a pad on the Android app to trigger a sample.
The pressure applied to the pad can be mapped to any of the following controls: level, height and high frequency filtering. The sensitivity can be adjusted for each.
The movement of the finger on the pad will cause the sound to move. This acts by measuring the deflection from the initial contact point like a joystick. This can be disabled.
All sets have their respective settings for the interaction.
Releasing the pad will stop the triggered sample.
Sampler settings are stored in the input files.
For convenience sample tiles and sets can be copied, exported and imported.

*Clusters*
Clusters are groups of inputs that can be manipulated and animated as a whole.
Each input can only be part of one cluster.
Each cluster can only have one input with tracking fully enabled. Then this input will become the reference points for the cluster.
If no input with tracking is part of the cluster then there are two modes for the reference point of the cluster. Either the first input assigned in the list becomes the reference or the barycentre, in other words the center of gravity or the middle of the shape formed by the assigned inputs.
All inputs of the clusters can be moved by dragging the reference point. The individual inputs (other than a first input that would be a reference point) can still be adjusted individually. Dragging an input with tracking activated that is also a reference point for a cluster will affect its position offset and the position of the other inputs of the cluster normally.
All inputs in a cluster can be rotated or scaled around the reference point.
All clusters can be assigned an animation via an LFO. The positions X, Y and Z, the rotation and scale of the cluster can be controlled. The LFO has a period and a phase setting. Each individual parameter has shape, amplitude, rate and phase. The LFO settings can be assigned to pads for a quick recall. A right click will store the LFO parameters to a pad. Double clicking the top of the pad will allow to edit the name of the preset. Clicking or tapping a pad will recall the settings whether the LFO is running or not, but it will not start it if is isn't. A double click/tap will load and start the LFO.
All input clusters share the same set of LFO presets.

*Map*
- A left click on an input or a cluster will allow to move it by dragging it. A single finger touch will do the same.
- A left click with the shift key pressed will add or remove inputs to the selection. A double tap and drag will act the same way.
- A left click drag will draw a selection rectangle to select multiple inputs and clusters at the same time.
- A left double-click or tap will reset the position offset of the input.
- A long left click or press with no movement will switch to the input tab with the focus on the selected input on release.
- A left click away from any input will clear the selection.
- A right click and drag will pan the view of the map. A two finger drag with no selected input or cluster will do the same if your operating system supports multitouch.
- The mouse wheel will zoom in and out. A two finger pinch with no selected input or cluster will also zoom on and out.
- A middle click will reset the view to fit the stage on the map display. There is also a dedicated set of buttons to reset the view to fit all inputs and to fit the stage respectively.
- Selected inputs and clusters can also be moved with the arrow keys for X and Y and with the PageUp and PageDown keys for height. Hardware controllers can be used too.
- When an input is touched, a second finger nearby can rotate the input directivity and adjust the height by pinching if your operating system allows multitouch interaction.
- When a cluster is touched, a second finger nearby can rotate the cluster and scale it by pinching.
- Inputs, output arrays and the reverb nodes can be hidden on the map.
- Inputs can also be locked to prevent selecting and moving them on the map. They will still be moved by clusters, network commands, tracking and hardware controllers.
- All reverb nodes can be moved on the map if this is enabled on the reverb tab. Holding the Ctrl/Cmd key will move each pair of reverb nodes in symmetry.
- Inputs with offsets, LFO or with speed regulation will have a temporary position marker. But the point of interaction will remain the normal marker.
- The Live Source Tamer radius will be displayed around input when activated.
- There is a toggle to display the audio level for the inputs and outputs on the map tab, that's active when the audio processing is running.
